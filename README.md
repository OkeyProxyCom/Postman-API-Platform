From the tutorial, you can learn about setting up a proxy in Postman with OkeyProxy and use the platform effectively.

# Understanding Postman API
Postman serves as a powerful API platform, providing the adaptability to set up proxies customized to your API needs. OkeyProxy, with its suite of superior features, emerges as the perfect companion for this platform. Its swift speeds and dependable connections guarantee a smooth API process with a proxy. A reliable connection reduces downtime and guarantees that your API requests are consistently transmitted and received. By integrating OkeyProxy with Postman, you can enhance your API performance.

# Proxies in Postman: A Brief Overview
A proxy serves as a go-between your device and the internet. When you connect via a proxy, your requests are forwarded to the target server by the proxy server instead of making a direct connection. This mechanism assists in concealing your actual IP address. In the context of Postman, a proxy functions as a middleman between Postman and an API. It operates as a security layer that intercepts HTTP(S) responses on the client's behalf.

By default, the platform utilizes the proxy configured on your local system to send API requests or access the internet. If necessary, you can provide authentication details for the default proxy within the desktop application. The app can also be set up to use either the system proxy or a custom proxy when dispatching requests. If you're ready to start, download and install the Postman desktop application.

# Personalized Proxy Configuration
You have the ability to establish a personalized proxy to convey API requests via a proxy server that differs from your system proxy. This grants you the adaptability to direct HTTP requests, HTTPS requests, or both kinds of requests through this personalized proxy as required.

Configuring OkeyProxy

1. Sign up for a new account or access your existing one on the OkeyProxy Platform.

2. In the dashboard, locate the “Residential Proxies” section. Choose “User Name Password” – “Endpoint generator”.

3. Select your preferred country and state for the IP in the location section.

4. Determine the session type as rotation or stickiness.

5. Opt for the output format “username:password@hostname: post”.

6. Specify the number of proxies you need.

7. Click on “generate” to obtain the proxy address, port, username, and password.

Remember, OkeyProxy residential proxies are compatible with Socks5 and HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

2. Proceed to “Proxy”. Deactivate “Use system proxy”, and activate “Use custom proxy configuration”.

3. Choose HTTP and HTTPS as the “Proxy type”. If both HTTP and HTTPS are selected, it implies that both types of requests will be routed through the proxy server.

4. Use the proxy address and port retrieved from the OkeyProxy dashboard to enter the details for the “Proxy server”.

5. Enable “Proxy auth”. Input the username and password from your OkeyProxy endpoint generator.

6. You can indicate hosts to bypass the proxy settings in “Proxy Bypass”. Once all settings are adjusted, it should look like the image displayed below.

By adhering to these steps, you will be able to smoothly incorporate OkeyProxy into the app for effective usage.
